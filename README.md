# 📊 eBPF-based TCP State Modeling for Slow HTTP Attack Detection

This project implements a lightweight, kernel-assisted detection approach for slow HTTP attacks (e.g., slow HTTP Header/Body/Read attacks), by modeling TCP state transitions and evaluating abnormal behaviors using **Jensen-Shannon (JS) divergence**.

> ⚠️ **Detection only** — this project focuses solely on identifying abnormal behavior. It does not include mitigation or active defense mechanisms.

---

## 🧠 Core Idea

By tracing TCP state transitions in real time via eBPF (attached to `kprobe__tcp_set_state`), we capture per-connection state transitions. User-space programs then collect these events and calculate the **JS divergence** from a learned baseline distribution. This allows us to detect anomalies in system-wide behavior—particularly those caused by slow HTTP attacks.

## 📜 File Descriptions

### 🔍 `user_jsdiv.py`

* Main user-space script for online detection.
* Attaches to kernel probe (`tcp_set_state`) via eBPF and tracks state transitions.
* Calculates JS divergence between observed behavior and a baseline (e.g., `baseline.json`).
* Stores:

  * **Live output**
  * **JS divergence values**
  * **CPU and memory usage statistics** (as `.csv` and `.json`)

### 🧪 `collect_baseline_short.py`

* Captures **normal system behavior** using a 10-second sliding window over 6 intervals.
* Stores averaged transition statistics as `.json`.
* Use this to validate feasibility and extract meaningful thresholds.

### 📂 `Data_analysis/`

* Contains all Jupyter notebooks for data visualization and divergence analysis.
* Includes:

  * `Probability_distribution_statistics.ipynb`: Visualizes collected distributions
  * `allJSKL.ipynb`: Compares JS vs KL divergence (see: [Notebook](https://github.com/awmwl/ebpf_JS_tcp_state/blob/main/Data_analysis/allJSKL.ipynb))
  * `js_threshold_analysis.ipynb`: Threshold tuning and generation of `baseline.json`

👉 A separate `README.md` exists in the `Data_analysis/` folder with more details.

### ⚙️ `AA_tcp_state_kl_kernel/`

* Initial proof-of-concept for **fully in-kernel** detection.
* Not yet fully functional; needs:

  1. Replace KL with JS divergence.
  2. Implement log() using **lookup tables** (no floating point support in eBPF).
  3. Modify `Makefile` for your environment — built with `libbpf` + CO-RE.

     * `.build/` holds compiled `libbpf` and `bpftool` binaries (customize as needed).

## 📊 Dataset Overview (from `Data_analysis/`)

## 📌 Notes

* **Why JS divergence?** See `Data_analysis/allJSKL.ipynb` — JS was more stable and discriminative across observed patterns.
* **eBPF constraints:** No floating-point support; JS calculation must use lookup tables for `log(x)` operations.
* **Compatibility:** This project uses **libbpf + CO-RE** style. You need a modern kernel and toolchain.
* Adjust `Makefile` and `.build/` paths to fit your environment.
